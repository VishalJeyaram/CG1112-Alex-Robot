# CG1112 Engineering Principles & Practices II: Alex Robot Project Group B04 2B, Year 1, Academic Year 2020-2021, Semester 2, National University of Singapore

We developed a cloud-controlled Search & Rescue (SAR) robot named Alex, using the Arduino Uno board (ATmega328P) as part of CG1112, configuring it to map and navigate uncertain terrain with LiDAR. The robot was programmed to retrieve mapping data over a Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) network onto a Robot Operating System (ROS), enabling efficient remote operation. The robot was meant to follow an obstacle course remotely via an Xbox controller, map its environment, detect a colour, and park successfully.
